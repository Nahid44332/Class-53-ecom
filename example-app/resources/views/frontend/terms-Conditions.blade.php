                      At E-commerce, we deeply respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use our e-commerce website.

                    When you place an order or create an account on our website, we may collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, shipping and billing address, and payment details. We also collect technical data like your IP address, browser type, and device information through cookies and other tracking technologies to enhance your experience on our site.

                    We use your information primarily to process your orders, provide customer service, improve our website and services, and send promotional offers (only with your consent). Your data helps us understand your preferences and offer you a more personalized shopping experience.

                    We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. However, we may share your information with trusted service providers such as payment gateways and courier partners to fulfill your orders. We may also disclose information when legally required to comply with applicable laws or respond to lawful requests by public authorities.

                    To protect your information, we implement appropriate security measures, including encryption and secure server protocols, to prevent unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. While we take your privacy seriously, please understand that no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

                    Our website uses cookies to provide you with a better browsing experience. Cookies help us remember your preferences, keep you logged in, and analyze site traffic. You can choose to disable cookies through your browser settings at any time.

                    Our services are not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them. If we become aware that such data has been collected, we will take steps to delete it immediately.

                    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through our website or via email. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your data.
